            <h4><u>The PODI Water Course</u></h4>
            <p class="paragraph">The world under the water is full of mystery, adventure, and discovery, diving is one
             of the most fun ways to engage within this whole unexplored world. The PODI water course is your entry into
             all things diving. In this short but intense course we will teach you all of the aspects necessary to dive
             in water, covering everything from in water technique to living the divers lifestyle. With this course
             anyone can learn to be the next Mike Nelson and explore the underwater world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> Our novel approach to teaching diving means that our course is one of the best when it
             comes to preparing divers for a large variety of possible adventures. We make sure to prepare divers to
             function at their best in both normal and emergency situations. We do this by perpetually instilling sense
             of fear and panic in divers throughout training, so that when they encounter difficulties after their
             course, they are able to handle the situation effectively. To ensure maximum prevention against Waters
             trainees getting drowning, PODI requires all students to be waterboarded repeatedly over the duration of
             the course to get them accustomed to the feeling of drowning. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> We also refuse to engage in the practice of kneeling as an attempt to make students
             easier to manage, instead we encourage the practice of acquiring a firm footing on all bottoms in order
             to ensure stability in the water. We also like to encourage disturbing sand on the bottom as silt ensures
             that there is a low visibility, which improves buddy cohesion and lost buddy drills, and makes for better
             divers.</p>
